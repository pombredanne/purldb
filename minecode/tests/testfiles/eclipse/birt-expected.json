Problems encountered when running Eclipse BIRT on non-reference platforms that cannot be recreated on any reference platform will be given lower priority than problems with running Eclipse BIRT on a reference platform.</p><p>For BIRT 3.7 SP2, the project team plans to tests and validate the following reference platforms:</p><table style=\"width: 825px; height: 188px;\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"><th colspan=\"4\"><div align=\"center\"><b><font size=\"+1\">Eclipse BIRT Report Framework 3.7 SR2 and Eclipse BIRT RCP Report Designer 3.7 SR2 Reference Platforms</font></b></div></th></tr><tr><td width=\"205\"><b>Operating system</b></td><td width=\"76\"><b>Processor architecture</b></td><td width=\"59\"><b>Window system</b></td><td width=\"453\"><b>Java 2 Platform</b></td></tr><tr><td width=\"205\">Microsoft Windows 7, 7 SP1</td><td width=\"76\">Intel x86</td><td width=\"59\">Win32</td><td>Sun Java 2 Standard Edition, version 1.5, 1.6</td></tr><tr><td width=\"205\">Microsoft Windows XP</td><td width=\"76\">Intel x86</td><td width=\"59\">Win32</td><td>Sun Java 2 Standard Edition, version 1.5, 1.6</td></tr><tr><td width=\"205\"> Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0, 6.1<br></br> Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS 5.0 </td><td width=\"76\">Intel x86</td><td width=\"59\">GTK</td><td width=\"453\">Sun Java 2 Standard Edition, version 1.5, 1.6</td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"><th colspan=\"4\"><div align=\"center\"><b><font size=\"+1\">Eclipse BIRT Runtime 3.7 SR2 and Eclipse BIRT Charts 3.7 SR2 Reference Platforms</font></b></div></th></tr><tr><td width=\"205\"><b>Operating system</b></td><td width=\"76\"><b>Processor architecture</b></td><td width=\"59\"><b>Window system</b></td><td width=\"453\"><b>Java 2 Platform</b></td></tr><tr><td width=\"205\">Microsoft Windows 7</td><td width=\"76\">Intel x86</td><td width=\"59\">Win32*</td><td width=\"453\">Sun Java 2 Standard Edition, version 1.5, 1.6</td></tr><tr><td width=\"205\">Microsoft Windows XP</td><td width=\"76\">Intel x86</td><td width=\"59\">Win32*</td><td width=\"453\">Sun Java 2 Standard Edition, version 1.5, 1.6</td></tr><tr><td width=\"205\"> Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0<br></br> Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS 5.0 <br></br> Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS 5.0 </td><td width=\"76\">Intel x86</td><td width=\"59\">GTK*</td><td width=\"453\">Sun Java 2 Standard Edition, version 1.5, 1.6</td></tr><tr><td width=\"205\">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9</td><td width=\"76\">Intel x86</td><td width=\"59\">YaST*</td><td width=\"453\">Sun Java 2 Standard Edition, version 1.5, 1.6</td></tr></tbody></table><div>*Window system only required when displaying charts within SWT or SWING windows.</div><br></br><br></br><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"><th colspan=\"1\"><div align=\"center\"><b><font size=\"+1\">BIRT Application Server Reference Platform</font></b></div></th></tr><tr><td width=\"405\">Apache Tomcat 5.5.x, 6.0.16, 7.0.20</td></tr><tr><td width=\"405\">JBoss AS 5.0, 7.0.1 </td></tr><tr><td width=\"405\">Oracle Weblogic Application Server 9.2, 10.3</td></tr><tr><td width=\"405\">IBM Websphere Application Server 6.1, 7.0, 8.0</td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"><th colspan=\"1\"><div align=\"center\"><b><font size=\"+1\">BIRT JDBC Reference Platforms</font></b></div></th></tr><tr><td width=\"405\">MySQL Connector/J 3.x JDBC driver</td></tr><tr><td width=\"405\">Derby V10.5.1.1 JDBC driver</td></tr><tr><td width=\"405\">Actuate DataDirect JDBC drivers</td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><a name=\"CommunityOperatingEnvironments\" id=\"CommunityOperatingEnvironments\">Community Tested Operating Environments</a></span><p>Due to the finite resources available to the BIRT project, we would like to encourage the BIRT community to contribute to testing BIRT in operating environments other than those listed as target operating environments for the 3.7 SR2 release of BIRT and to share this information with the rest of the community.

Problems encountered when running Eclipse BIRT on non-reference platforms that cannot be recreated on any reference platform will be given lower priority than problems with running Eclipse BIRT on a reference platform.</p><p>For BIRT 2.6 SR2, the project team plans to tests and validate the following reference platforms:</p><table style=\"width: 825px; height: 188px;\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"><th colspan=\"4\"><div align=\"center\"><b><font size=\"+1\">Eclipse BIRT Report Framework 2.6 SR2 and Eclipse BIRT RCP Report Designer 2.6 SR2 Reference Platforms</font></b></div></th></tr><tr><td width=\"205\"><b>Operating system</b></td><td width=\"76\"><b>Processor architecture</b></td><td width=\"59\"><b>Window system</b></td><td width=\"453\"><b>Java 2 Platform</b></td></tr><tr><td width=\"205\">Microsoft Windows XP</td><td width=\"76\">Intel x86</td><td width=\"59\">Win32</td><td>Sun Java 2 Standard Edition, version 5.0, 6.0</td></tr><tr><td width=\"205\">Microsoft Windows Server 2003</td><td width=\"76\">Intel x86</td><td width=\"59\">Win32</td><td width=\"453\">Sun Java 2 Standard Edition, version 5.0, 6.0</td></tr><tr><td>Microsoft Windows Vista</td><td>Intel x86</td><td>Win32</td><td>Sun Java 2 Standard Edition, version 5.0, 6.0</td></tr><tr><td width=\"205\"> Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS 4.0<br></br> Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS 4.0, 5.0 </td><td width=\"76\">Intel x86</td><td width=\"59\">GTK</td><td width=\"453\">Sun Java 2 Standard Edition, version 5.0, 6.0</td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"><th colspan=\"4\"><div align=\"center\"><b><font size=\"+1\">Eclipse BIRT Runtime 2.6 SR2 and Eclipse BIRT Charts 2.6 SR2 Reference Platforms</font></b></div></th></tr><tr><td width=\"205\"><b>Operating system</b></td><td width=\"76\"><b>Processor architecture</b></td><td width=\"59\"><b>Window system</b></td><td width=\"453\"><b>Java 2 Platform</b></td></tr><tr><td width=\"205\">Microsoft Windows XP</td><td width=\"76\">Intel x86</td><td width=\"59\">Win32*</td><td width=\"453\">Sun Java 2 Standard Edition, version 5.0, 6.0</td></tr><tr><td width=\"205\">Microsoft Windows Server 2003</td><td width=\"76\">Intel x86</td><td width=\"59\">Win32*</td><td width=\"453\">Sun Java 2 Standard Edition, version 5.0, 6.0</td></tr><tr><td>Microsoft Windows Vista</td><td>Intel x86</td><td>Win32*</td><td>Sun Java 2 Standard Edition, version 5.0, 6.0</td></tr><tr><td width=\"205\">Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS 4.0<br></br> Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS 4.0, 5.0</td><td width=\"76\">Intel x86</td><td width=\"59\">GTK*</td><td width=\"453\">Sun Java 2 Standard Edition, version 5.0, 6.0</td></tr><tr><td width=\"205\">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9</td><td width=\"76\">Intel x86</td><td width=\"59\">YaST*</td><td width=\"453\">Sun Java 2 Standard Edition, version 5.0, 6.0</td></tr></tbody></table><div>*Window system only required when displaying charts within SWT or SWING windows.</div><br></br><br></br><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"><th colspan=\"1\"><div align=\"center\"><b><font size=\"+1\">BIRT Application Server Reference Platform</font></b></div></th></tr><tr><td width=\"405\">Apache Tomcat 5.5.x, 6.0.16</td></tr><tr><td width=\"405\">JBoss AS 5.1</td></tr><tr><td width=\"405\">Oracle Weblogic Application Server 8.1, 9.0, 10.3</td></tr><tr><td width=\"405\">IBM Websphere Application Server 6.1</td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"><th colspan=\"1\"><div align=\"center\"><b><font size=\"+1\">BIRT JDBC Reference Platforms</font></b></div></th></tr><tr><td width=\"405\">MySQL Connector/J 3.x JDBC driver</td></tr><tr><td width=\"405\">Derby V10.5.1.1 JDBC driver</td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"><th colspan=\"1\"><div align=\"center\"><b><font size=\"+1\">BIRT Browsers and Viewers Reference Platforms</font></b></div></th></tr><tr><td width=\"405\">Mozilla Firefox 2.0, 3.0 </td></tr><tr><td width=\"405\">Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0, 8.0</td></tr><tr><td width=\"405\">Adobe Acrobat Reader 7.0, 8.0, 9.0</td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><a name=\"CommunityOperatingEnvironments\" id=\"CommunityOperatingEnvironments\">Community Tested Operating Environments</a></span><p>Due to the finite resources available to the BIRT project, we would like to encourage the BIRT community to contribute to testing BIRT in operating environments other than those listed as target operating environments for the 2.6 SR2 release of BIRT and to share this information with the rest of the community.

Extension plug-ins for prior BIRT releases will be upwards binary-compatible with BIRT 2.6 SR1.</p><p><b>Source Compatibility:</b> BIRT 2.6 SR1 will be upwards source-compatible with prior BIRT releases to the greatest extent possible. This means that source files written to use prior BIRT release APIs will successfully compile and run against BIRT 2.6 SR1 APIs. Downward source compatibility is not supported. If source files use new BIRT APIs, they will not be usable with an earlier version of BIRT.</p><p><b>Report Design Compatibility:</b>BIRT 2.6 SR1 will be upwards report design compatible with prior BIRT releases unless noted otherwise.

This means that source files written to use prior BIRT release APIs will successfully compile and run against BIRT 2.5 SR1 APIs. Downward source compatibility is not supported. If source files use new BIRT APIs, they will not be usable with an earlier version of BIRT.</p><p><b>Report Design Compatibility:</b>BIRT 2.5 SR1 will be upwards report design compatible with prior BIRT releases unless noted otherwise.

We also aim to minimize the effort required to port an existing plug-in to the 2.5 APIs.</p><b>Compatibility of Release 2.5 with Prior Releases</b><p>BIRT 2.5 will be compatible with prior releases of BIRT unless noted otherwise. The detailed compatibility statement is listed below. In this statement, \"BIRT\" refers to all BIRT components: BIRT Report Framework, BIRT Runtime, and BIRT Chart SDK.</p><p><b>API Contract Compatibility:</b> BIRT 2.5 will be upwards contract-compatible with BIRT prior releases to the greatest extent possible. All incompatibility exceptions will be documented.Downward contract compatibility is not supported. There is no guarantee that compliance with BIRT 2.5 APIs will ensure compliance with prior BIRT release APIs.

Downward plug-in compatibility is not supported. Plug-ins for BIRT 2.5 will not be usable in prior BIRT releases. Extension plug-ins for prior BIRT releases will be upwards binary-compatible with BIRT 2.5.</p><p><b>Source Compatibility:</b> BIRT 2.5 will be upwards source-compatible with prior BIRT releases to the greatest extent possible. This means that source files written to use prior BIRT release APIs will successfully compile and run against BIRT 2.5 APIs. Downward source compatibility is not supported.
